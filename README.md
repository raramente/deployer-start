# Deployer WordPress starter project

A starter project to deploy WordPress websites using [Deployer](https://deployer.org/). Meant to be used with with [Bedrock](https://roots.io/bedrock/) and [Sage](https://roots.io/sage/) to speed up development.

## What does it do?

- Groups all of the configuration into a single file: ```deploy-config.yaml```
- Changes the provision recipe to install nvm (node), npm and yarn
- Installs composer on the WordPress installation and on the theme
- Adds tasks for managing files
- Adds tasks for managing the database

## Set up

Download this repo and edit:

- deploy-config.yaml - Edit all of the variables according to the needs of the project and your server.

## Provisioning

If you choose to provision the server using deployer this will add a task in order to intalls nvm, npm and yarn to the server. This will be needed to build the [Sage](https://roots.io/sage/) theme.

```bash
dep provision 
```

## Deploying

Runing the deployer deploy command is enough to deploy the website:

```bash
dep deploy
```

A few extra tasks will run in order to properly deploy a Bedrock and Sage website:

- `config:check` - Checks if all the variables are set.
- `deploy:vendors` - Will run composer install on the WordPress bedrock installation
- `deploy:theme:vendors` - Will run composer on the theme
- `deploy:theme:resources` - Will compile the theme assets
- `hangouts:success` or `hangouts:failure` - Will send notifications to a Google Hangouts channel
- `wp:cache:clear` - After deployment is done, all caches will be flushed
